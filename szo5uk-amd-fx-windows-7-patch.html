So this is a shorter summary. I remember when I first decided to back the game in Summer 2015, but was met with harassment and attacks by the "fan" base because I was asking questions and voicing concern.

I've been getting some horrible fps drops and they have been happening for a long time so it's not about the patch. When I got my fps uncapped it's usually around 90 but it suddenly drops to around 48 throwing me off quite badly. I know it's not about my GPU since I have a GTX 1050ti and also my friends with the same card play just fine with higher settings than me. I'm thinking it's my CPU bottlenecking.

I know many people often have poor performance when playing Morrowind, which is as far as I know because it can only utilize 1 core. But I haven't found any posts online of people going from amazing performance (200-300 fps) to crap performance (40-50 fps) with no hardware change. I installed Morrowind probably around a year ago. I'm not actually sure if I have the same hardware. I "upgraded" to new hardware, but it was from a friend so I don't have any receipts or anything

AMD is the centralized location for the latest security updates as we ensure the safety of our users. So my game often crashes in Raven Rock and Markarth when trying to perform the aforementioned actions. The issue is I am not entirely sure of the culprit, as the HDD where Skyrim SE is installed is really old (over 10 years old), so it's either that or one of my installed mods causes the problem. I am suspecting my HDD might be responsible since the game begins to freeze a lot (sometimes even for more than 5 seconds), my HDD makes a lot of noise and my memory usage i recently bought a amd fx-8120 8 core processor,am3+ motherboard,radeon 6850 hd video card,after i got it found out that windows 7 does not support it's functions yet.ie,(simultaneous hyper. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ EDIT: AN UPDATED VERSION OF THIS GUIDE IS NOW AVAILIABLE!! https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/8riiqk/and\_refined\_my\_texture\_and\_modding\_guide\_140/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/8riiqk/and_refined_my_texture_and_modd.

Hello everybody, I keep getting a BSOD when playing ACOD, the code is WHEA\_UNCORRECTABLE\_ERROR, I understand this is a hardware error. I've went through and updated all drivers. I've ran a memtest, chkdsk, and sfc scan. All of these came back with no issues at all. But the BSOD still appears. Assassin's Creed od is the only game that currently does this.
